Great question — and you're asking it at the *right moment*.

Since you don’t yet have an interpreter that can **run** the AST, your goal should be to **verify structure**, not behavior.

Here’s a practical and layered strategy to test and gain confidence in your categorizer while you build it:

---

## ✅ 1. **AST Snapshot Tests**

**What to do:**

* Feed in source code → get flat tokens → build AST → dump AST as indented or JSON-formatted text
* Compare output to expected structure

**How to use:**

```euphoria
#x = -5
print $(numstr #(#x + 10))
```

Should produce something like:

```json
{
  "type": "action",
  "factory_id": "assign",
  "tokens": [
    { "type": "resolvable", "name": "#x" },
    {
      "type": "literal",
      "factory_id": "number",
      "tokens": [
        { "type": "literal", "name": "-5" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Tools:**

* Write a `pretty_print_ast()` or `ast_to_json()` function
* Save expected outputs as `.golden` or `.expected` files

---

## ✅ 2. **Human-Readable Tree Dumps**

Sometimes JSON is too noisy. You can also emit something like this:

```text
assign
├── var_number: #x
└── literal: -5
```

Or even:

```text
print
└── call:numstr
    └── add
        ├── var_number: #x
        └── literal: 10
```

Use indentation and arrows to spot grouping problems quickly.

---

## ✅ 3. **Invariants / Structural Assertions**

Embed checks like:

* Every `action` must have 1+ child tokens
* Every `group_*` must end in a matching `group_close`
* No dangling tokens after AST construction
* Depth never exceeds X levels (to detect runaway nesting)

Make a `validate_ast(ast)` function that enforces these.

---

## ✅ 4. **Golden Round-Trip**

Eventually, build a “flatten again” tool:

* AST → token stream → source string

If it matches the original (or is functionally equivalent), you know the AST is correctly preserving meaning.

This can evolve into a **decompiler** or **formatter** later.

---

## ✅ 5. **Redundant AST Runners**

Even before building a VM, you could create **mock AST evaluators** that:

* Run limited math-only trees (`assign`, `add`, `literal`)
* Return final values for simple expressions
* Print a trace of operations

This gives you **progressive execution confidence** before full VM design.

## 🧠 Summary: Testing Without Execution

| Method                | Purpose                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Snapshot tests        | Ensure structural output is correct     |
| Tree printers         | Debug groupings, nesting, relationships |
| Structural validators | Catch incomplete or malformed ASTs      |
| Round-trip tools      | Confirm AST -> source fidelity          |
| Mock evaluators       | Gradual execution simulation            |

Would you like a helper that generates these trees or a testing harness to formalize this?
