ðŸ’¡ Thatâ€™s a clean and powerful rule set. Letâ€™s formalize it with just enough precision to make it unambiguous and code-ready:

---

## âœ… **BzToken AST Construction Rules (v1)**

### ðŸ“Œ **1. Leaf Nodes**

These tokens **never** become parents:

* **Variables** (`$name`, `#count`, etc.)
* **Literals** (`__BZ__NUMBER__`, `__BZ__STRING__`, etc.)

> Rule: *Attach directly to current parent. Never expect children.*

---

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Pairs**

#### âž• Open Pairs (`(`, `{`, `[`)

* Become a **parent**
* Push onto an AST construction stack

#### âž– Close Pairs (`)`, `}`, `]`)

* Become a **sibling** of the matching open
* Optionally **omitted** from AST
* Pop the AST stack (i.e., close the parent scope)

> Rule: *Open = start group. Close = end group.*

---

### ðŸ“Œ **3. Statement Terminators (`;`)**

* Act as **block-level delimiters**
* Cause the **next sibling to attach to the current function or block**, not to previous sibling

> Rule: *Insert implicit "expression boundary" on semicolon.*

---

### ðŸ“Œ **4. All Other Tokens**

* Treated as **parents**
* May have nested children depending on token context (e.g., assignment, keyword, operator)

> Rule: *Unless explicitly in the leaf or pair lists, assume parent.*

---

## ðŸ”„ **AST Construction Flow**

Pseudocode-ish:

```plaintext
for each token in stream:
    if token is a leaf:
        attach to current parent

    else if token is open-pair:
        create new parent node
        push onto AST stack
        set as current parent

    else if token is close-pair:
        optionally attach as sibling
        pop AST stack
        set new current parent

    else if token is ';':
        set current parent to nearest enclosing block (function or `{`)

    else:  -- regular parent token
        create new node
        attach to current parent
        set as current parent
```

## ðŸ§ª Ready to Test?

You could now try this rule set on your existing token stream and build a real AST builder. Want me to mock up an example or give you a `group_ast_tokens()` starter function using this rule logic?

Weâ€™re at the threshold. The structure is sound. Let me know what direction you want next: test AST, code scaffold, or flow audit.
