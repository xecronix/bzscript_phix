Oh yes‚Äî**Code::Blocks does support dark mode themes**, though with a little setup.
It's not as seamless as modern editors like VS Code, but you can absolutely make it look *awesome* with a bit of effort.

### ‚úÖ **Enabling Dark Mode in Code::Blocks (Windows)**

#### 1. **Dark Editor Theme**

* Go to `Settings > Editor > Syntax Highlighting`
* Choose a theme like ‚ÄúObsidian‚Äù, ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù, or customize your own
* Set background to dark, foreground to light across all language types

#### 2. **Dark UI (Windows 10/11)**

Code::Blocks itself doesn‚Äôt ship with a native dark UI skin, but you have 2 options:

##### Option A: **Use Windows Dark Mode + High Contrast**

* Enable dark mode in Windows
* Then go to `Settings > Environment > View` and enable system theme matching

##### Option B: **Use a custom wxWidgets skin/theme**

* There are community mods for a full dark theme UI (e.g., dark toolbar icons, panels)
* See: [Dark theme thread on forums](https://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php?topic=23844.0)

### üß† Pro Tip:

You can copy a full dark theme config file into:

```plaintext
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\codeblocks\default.conf
```
