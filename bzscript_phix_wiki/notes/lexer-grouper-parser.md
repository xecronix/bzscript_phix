Perfect â€” thanks for the correction. Here's the fully adjusted breakdown with your clarification:

---

## ðŸ§  **BZScript Lexer & Grouper Architecture (Clarified)**

### âœ… **Pass 1 â€“ Raw Character Tokenization (`lexer.e` â€“ Phase 1)**

* Converts **every character** into a standalone token.
* No interpretation or grouping yet â€” just raw atomic elements.
* Example:

  ```bzscript
  let #x = 5;
  ```

  becomes:

  ```
  ["l", "e", "t", " ", "#", "x", " ", "=", " ", "5", ";"]
  ```

---

### âœ… **Pass 2 â€“ Token Consolidation (`lexer.e` â€“ Phase 2)**

* Consolidates raw tokens into:

  * **Keywords** (`let`, `if`, `fun`, etc.)
  * **Literal Numbers** (`42`, `3.14`)
  * **Literal Strings** (\`hello world\`)
  * **Operators** (`==`, `+=`, `<=`)
* **Strips**:

  * **Whitespace**
  * **Comments**
* ðŸ’¡ **Leaves sigils and variable names separate.**

  * `#` and `x` remain separate at this point: `["let", "#", "x", "="]`

---

### âœ… **Pass 3 â€“ Token Grouping (`grouper.e`)**

* **Fuses sigils + variable names** into identifiers like `#x`, `@data`, `$flag`.
* Applies **group logic**:

  * Parentheses â†’ math/condition group
  * Brackets â†’ sequences
  * Braces â†’ blocks
* **Performs lightweight validation**:

  * Ensures matching brackets
  * Can do minor rewrites (e.g. fixup for `let #x = ...`)
* Leaves behind a stream of **AST-capable tokens**, now ready for parsing.
