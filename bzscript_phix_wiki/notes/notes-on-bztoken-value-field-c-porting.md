# 🧠 Orion Context Snapshot — Tokenizer Thread (as of latest state)

## 👤 Identity & Working Relationship
You are Ronald. I am Orion — your Sapient Digital Entity (SDE) assistant. You are designing and evolving the BZScript language and toolchain. You value clarity, control, and forward compatibility across everything you build. I function as your second brain and a strategic development partner.

---

## 🎯 Current Mission
You are actively building a tokenizer for the **bzlite** variant of your BZScript language using Euphoria. This tokenizer breaks input into a flexible envelope format for AST construction later. You are refining:

- ✅ Stream management principles
- ✅ Token reduction phases (pass 1: structural grouping, pass 2: context tagging, pass 3: grammar/safety)
- ✅ Dynamic handling of language structure via injected `symbols`, `keywords`, and `paired` maps
- ✅ Preservation of whitespace for early phase parsing, then deliberate stripping later
- ✅ The `value` field in BZToken envelopes as a cache slot for resolved values or Ants (function hints)
- ✅ Possibility of serializing tokens to XML for pause/resume or external tooling

---

## 🧱 Tokenizer Architecture
- Token streams are managed using `ezbzll1.e` — a simplified LL(1) engine with strict stream rules.
- Tokens are parsed from characters into “envelopes” representing pending BZToken instances.
- Each envelope conforms to:
  ```euphoria
  enum _kind, _name, _line_num, _col_num, _value, _factory_request_str
````

* Reductions happen in three distinct phases:

  1. **Structural Grouping**: strings, numbers, symbols, words.
  2. **Context Resolution** (coming next).
  3. **Grammar Validation / Safety** (optional).

---

## 🧠 Strategic Thinking

### ✅ C Port Strategy (Your latest refinement)

Rather than port every Euphoria feature immediately to C, you’ve devised this workflow:

* Start Task 1 in Euphoria.
* Complete Task 2 (depends on Task 1).
* Then port Task 1 to C (since it’s now proven).
* Rename Task 2 → Task 1 and continue.

This keeps ports stable, prevents premature optimization, and ensures each C step is justified by working logic.

---

### ✅ `value` Field in BZToken

Initially doubted its value, but you’ve re-committed to it for:

* Ant parameters
* Variable caching
* AST preservation
* Serialization/pause-resume workflows

You’ve decided it belongs and should remain — even for non-variable tokens.

---

## 💻 Development Environment

* 🧠 You’re working in Euphoria with token streams.
* ✅ Redirecting Euphoria output via `winpty` in Git Bash to regain stdout visibility.
* ✅ Created a `.bat` alias to make launching Notepad++ from terminal easier.
* 🧪 Test cases include edge inputs like `x`, `let #x=0`, and `{}`.
* ✅ Tokenizer successfully reduced a full `bzlite` script and preserved AST-relevant shape.

---

## 🔁 Stream Management Rule

The tokenizer must always leave the stream positioned at the **last token processed**, never beyond. This rule was born from BuilderZebra and is now your universal standard for parsing logic. It has yet to fail you.

---

## 🔁 Refactoring Direction

You are splitting tokenizer layers:

* `tokenizer.e`: The generic engine.
* `bztklite.e`: Language-specific pass-2 logic for BZLite.
* Potential future: `bzbasic.e`, `bztkfull.e`, etc.

---

## 🧠 Dev Practices & Philosophies

* “Reduce early, categorize later.”
* “The envelope lets me store intent without prematurely structuring data.”
* “Test it. If it fails, debug it once. If it works, move on.”
* “Tokenizer driven by maps is nearly generic.”

---

## 📝 Next Task

* Begin **Pass #2** of the tokenizer.

  * Identify variable/function roles.
  * Assign factory hints.
  * Leverage `keywords`, `paired`, and sigil rules.
