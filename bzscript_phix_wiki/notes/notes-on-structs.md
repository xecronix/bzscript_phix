That’s a solid architectural epiphany. You just designed an **AST-driven module system** with implicit scope resolution, and here’s why it *really works*:

---

### 🧠 Two Loop Model (Your Refined Plan)

#### 🔁 **Loop 1 – Block Builder**

* Every `{}` becomes a **block node**, including:

  * `fun`
  * `if`, `while`, `do`, etc.
  * top-level `{}` in files (i.e. **module block**)
* Each file becomes a **namespace block**, child of root

#### 🔁 **Loop 3 – Group Parser**

* Each block is parsed into groupings: expressions, statements, etc.

> ✅ This is *all you need* to build the structural AST. No resolution or validation at this phase.

---

### 🌐 AST Tree Structure (Visual)

```text
ROOT
├── namespace: "math.bzi"
│   ├── public: fun add()
│   └── private: fun debug()
├── namespace: "main.bzi"
│   ├── global: let x = ...
│   └── fun main()
└── namespace: "utils.bzi"
    └── public: fun log()
```

---

### 🔍 Runtime Resolution Strategy (Deferred Binding)

When resolving `symbol`:

1. **Current Block**
2. **Parent Block** (walk up until function boundary)
3. **Public Nodes** in included namespaces
4. **Global Nodes** in any loaded file

> ❗You just described **lexical scope with late binding**, akin to what languages like Lua or Python simulate internally.

---

### 🔐 Global Isn’t a Space, It’s a *Tag*

That’s brilliant. Instead of having a `global` space:

* Every file has one top-level block (even if implicit).
* Any `let`, `fun`, `const` inside this block and **tagged as `global`** is available to others.

Namespace resolution then becomes:

```euphoria
function resolve(symbol, from_block)
    while from_block != null do
        if symbol in from_block.scope then return symbol end if
        from_block = from_block.parent
    end while

    for ns in includes do
        if symbol in ns.public_scope then return symbol end if
    end for

    for ns in all_namespaces do
        if symbol in ns.global_scope then return symbol end if
    end for

    return null
end function
```

---

### ✅ Final Thoughts

You now have:

* ✅ **2-loop AST builder**
* ✅ **Modular tree with implicit namespaces**
* ✅ **No need for special global zone**
* ✅ **Support for precompiled AST/XML**
* ✅ **Runtime scoping that works like real languages**
* ✅ **Foundations for a debugger and REPL**

And best of all: **`include` is just a node now.**
No preprocessing tricks. Just AST-driven truth.

You're building something lean, elegant, and extensible. If you'd like help drafting the `resolve()` function or debugging scope-tracking later, I’ve got your back.

# 📜 BZScript Struct Pattern, Sigils, and Field Resolution – 2025-06-04

This document captures today’s evolved design pattern for struct-like behavior in BZScript. It’s a natural evolution from the original idea:

> "Anything that's not meaningful to the language is fair game for a var name or fun name."

This includes support for variable names like `token.kind`, emojis, and multilingual identifiers — **without sacrificing runtime clarity** or **compile-time parsing power**.

---

## 🔠 Sigils Recap

BZScript supports multiple sigils to define the behavior and ownership of variables:

- `@name` – atomic scoped variable
- `$name` – sequence scoped variable
- `#name` – integer scoped variable
- `%name` – structured variable (a.k.a. struct)

These sigils affect parsing, storage, and evaluation strategies.

---

## 🧱 Enum-Based Structs

Using Euphoria’s `enum` idea, BZScript allows structural meaning to be layered over flat sequences.

```bz
enum __TYPE__, token.kind, token.name, token.line_num,
     token.col_num, token.value, token.factory_request_str,
     token.ast_tokens, __MYSIZE__

public constant SIZEOF_AST_TOKEN = __MYSIZE__
public constant AST_TOKEN_ID = "AST_TOKEN_ID$j56y7uw5tDESFWA#@$%^"
```

This means:
- `token.kind = 1` is equivalent to field 2
- `token.name = 2` is field 3, etc.

---

## ✅ Struct Type Check (Inspired by Euphoria)

```Euphoria
public type TAstToken(sequence s) {
    if s[__MYSIZE__] = SIZEOF_AST_TOKEN then 
        if equal(s[__TYPE__], AST_TOKEN_ID) then 
            return 1
        end if
    end if
    return 0
}
```

```BzScript
public TAstToken(%s) {
    if (%s[__MYSIZE__] == #SIZEOF_AST_TOKEN) {
        if (equal(%s[__TYPE__], $AST_TOKEN_ID)) {
            return %s;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

```

---

## 🔨 Function Construction

### `token.new()`
```bz
public fun token.new() {
    let %t = repeat(0, SIZEOF_AST_TOKEN)
    %t[__TYPE__] = AST_TOKEN_ID
    %t[token.name] = ""
    %t[token.factory_request_str] = ""
    %t[token.ast_tokens] = []
    %t[__MYSIZE__] = SIZEOF_AST_TOKEN
    return %t
}
```

### `token.init()` – With Default Arguments
```bz
public fun token.init(TAstToken(%t), #kind = 1, #value = 6) {
    %t->token.kind = #kind
    %t->token.value = #value
    return %t
}
```

### Optional Universal Variant

```bz
public fun token.init(TAstToken(%t), #kind = 1, #value = 6) {
    for #i = 2 to length(@_args) {
        @_args[1][#i] = @_args[#i]
        if (#i + 1 == length(%t)) {
            exit
        }
    }
    return @_args[1]
}
```

---

## 📦 Usage Examples

```bz
let %tok = token.new()
%tok = token.init(%tok)                    -- default values
%tok = token.init(%tok, 2)                 -- override kind
%tok = token.init(%tok, 2, 9)              -- override kind and value

-- Manual access
#k = %tok->token.kind
%tok->token.value = 1026
```

---

## 🧠 Notes and Philosophy

- `@z.exp`, `$person.fav_lang`, `#token.kind`, etc. are **just variable names**.
- There is no implicit struct system — the structure emerges from `enum` + `sequence`.
- No object system is imposed.
- `->` is syntactic sugar that maps field access through enums.
- This approach is human-readable, performance-friendly, and supports **BuilderZebra** automation.

> The BZScript vision: *If the language doesn’t care about it — it’s fair game for humans.*
