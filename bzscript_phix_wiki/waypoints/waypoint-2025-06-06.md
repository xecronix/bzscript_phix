### ✅ `waypoint_2025_06_06.md`

```markdown
# ✅ Waypoint — 2025-06-06

## 🧠 Major Concepts Finalized
- Clarified the **three-stage architecture** of the BZScript frontend:
  1. Lexer Pass 1 → 1 char = 1 token
  2. Lexer Pass 2 → consolidate literals/keywords, strip comments/whitespace
  3. Grouper      → fuse sigil+name, structure expressions, validate bracket groups

## 💡 Language Design Rule
- `let #x = 5;` is rewritten in AST as:
```

let #x;
\#x = 5;

```
- If `let #x;` is seen, no assignment follows — do nothing.
- If `let #x =` is seen — duplicate `#x`, insert `;`, then continue.

## 🔧 Code Updates
- Implemented conditional behavior for `let` in `bztklite.e`
- Added defensive copy with `copy_token()` for safe duplication
- Preserved style preference for `-- do nothing` branches (clarity over brevity)

## 🗂️ Files Added
- `lexer-grouper-parser.md`: Full breakdown of frontend stages
- `notes-on-structs.md`, `more-notes-on-structs.md`, `even-more-notes-on-structs.md`: Continued exploration of internal structure models

## 🛠️ Files Modified
- `ast.e`, `ast_token.e`: Token type model adjustments and safety changes
- `bztklite.e`: Behavior patching for `let` and sigil logic. Added meta data for where child tokens are related to parent (left,right both, no children, etc)
- `language.e`: Possibly enum/factory-related cleanup. Added sequnce for keeping left, right, etc. added child meta to all keywords and symbols.

## ✅ Summary
All lexer/grouper/parser stages are now **clearly delineated**, with AST output verified through multiple functional examples (including nested blocks and function calls). Rewrites for `let` assignments are working as intended. Style and rule preferences are fully respected.

Next phase: parser cleanup or mid-pipeline optimization.
