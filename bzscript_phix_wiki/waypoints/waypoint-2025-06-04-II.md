# 🧭 Waypoint – 2025-06-04 II

## ✅ Refactor & Validation Milestone

Today marks a major consolidation and confidence boost in the BZScript engine.

### 🔨 Codebase Changes
- **Deleted:** `bztoken.e` in favor of a unified and typed `ast_token.e`
- **Deleted:** `LL1_stream.e` in favor of `ezbzll1.e` (leaner logic, fewer assumptions)
- **Deleted:** Obsolete tests and logs:
  - `bzscript.log`
  - `bztoken_test.ex`
  - `ll1_stream_test.ex`

### ✨ What’s Working Well
- TAstToken type validation is **transformative** — acting as a solid contract layer for recursive parsing
- Recursive group and math reduction are functioning correctly, even with nested + mixed data types
- Comment clarity is high — self-reviewed and still understandable without deep mental stack rebuilding

### 🧼 Code Hygiene Notes
- About **1500 total lines**, with at least **200 dedicated to inline comments** in core files
- 4 core files are structurally tight and require little cleanup
- Two unused logging modules (`bzlog.e`, `logger.e`) remain staged for possible cleanup or integration

### 🤔 Trade-offs Acknowledged
- Replacing `LL1_stream.e` with `ezbzll1.e` was a practical decision that came with some trade-offs — but aligns with current engine shape and velocity
- Validation for malformed input is left to pre-AST stages — intentional architectural decision

### 🔥 Current Vibe
> “I expected to be cleaning — but I was already clean. That’s a good sign.”

This is a foundation that holds. Confidence is high. Refactor is done. Time to build up again.
