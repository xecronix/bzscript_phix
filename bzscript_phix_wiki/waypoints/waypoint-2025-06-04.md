# ðŸ§­ Waypoint: 2025-06-04

## âœ… Summary of Progress
- Successfully refactored the core of `op_math` down to ~4 lines by offloading parsing to `parse_expression`
- Introduced `op_group()` to reduce deep nested expressions (group/sequence tokens)
- Added logic placeholders in `op_sequence()` for group handling, expression parsing, and token segmentation (currently logs only)
- Implemented a test case `{#n=((((#x+1)*2)-((3/(#y+4))+5)));}` to verify correct grouping and AST layout
- Planning XML export format: `xml_notes.e` introduced as a stub and notes module
- Began tracking parsing behavior of deeply nested math for serialization

## ðŸ”„ Files Changed
- `ast.e`: Major AST engine changes; deep nesting logic added; `op_math()` simplified; `op_group()` now wraps expressions correctly
- `bztklite.e`, `tokenizer.e`, `language.e`: Minor required tweaks to enable deep nesting and group/sequence clarity
- `sequence-replaces-arrays.md`: New document explaining array â†’ sequence design choice
- `deep-nested-test-valid.txt`: Test case for ultra-nested expression handling
- `xml_notes.e`: New file for planned XML export routines
- `waypoint-2025-06-01.md`: Updated with today's milestone

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Finish `op_sequence()` handling for comma-separated arguments or statement blocks
- Add support for multiple sibling expressions within `{}` blocks
- Implement `to_xml()` traversal/export starting with expression subtree
- Explore capturing variable scoping for future control-flow resolution
