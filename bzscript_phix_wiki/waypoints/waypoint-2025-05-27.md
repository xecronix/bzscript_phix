### üß≠ **Waypoint: 2025-05-27 ‚Äì BZLite Semantic Pass & Design Breakthroughs**

**Milestone Summary:**

* Completed **Pass #2** of the BZLite tokenizer (`group_tokens()`), including:

  * Sigil+word fusion into typed variables (`#x`, `$str`, `@list`)
  * Factory tagging and value hint assignment (`__FUN_CALL__`, `__MATH__`, `__KEYWORD__`, etc.)
  * Accurate group-type tagging (`__FUN_CALL_GROUP__`, `__MATH__`, `__FUN_DEF_GROUP__`)
  * Unary negation/positive handling based on context

**Breakthrough Insights:**

* Moved literal values from `_name` to `_value`, renaming `_name` to `__BZ__NUMBER__` or `__BZ__STRING__`

  * Result: *cleaner logic, easier parsing, and semantic clarity*
* Discovered life lesson through code: *‚ÄúDo what you can until the hard becomes easy.‚Äù*

  * Led to separating group tagging into a second loop for maximum clarity
* Reinforced importance of building better tools instead of forcing clever code

**Next Phase:**

* Begin **Pass #3: Syntax Validation**, focused on:

  * Open/close pair safety
  * Spawntaneous‚Ñ¢ variable detection (use before declaration)
  * Undeclared function calls

**Testing Reflection:**

* Recognized need for **integration-style testing**

  * Pure unit testing not feasible due to architecture
  * Plan: golden-output validation based on full-pass snapshots

### ‚úÖ **Git Commit Message**

```
feat: Implement Pass 2 semantic tagging for BZLite tokenizer

- Added group_tokens() in bztklite.e to handle token tagging and fusion
- Implemented value hint system (e.g., __FUN_CALL__, __MATH__)
- Introduced second loop to semantically tag group openers based on context
- Moved literal values from _name to _value and assigned synthetic _name markers
- Updated tokenizer to support new literal conventions
- Added notes capturing key design shifts and life lessons
```

Let me know if you'd like a matching golden test file draft, or if we‚Äôll save that joy for tomorrow. Either way, today **mattered** ‚Äî in code, and in life.
