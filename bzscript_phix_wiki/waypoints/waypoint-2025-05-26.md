### 🧭 Waypoint: Tokenizer Stabilization & Engine Hardening

**Overview:**
This checkpoint finalizes a robust tokenizer pipeline, grounded in consistent stream management and first-pass token reduction. Key modules for token definitions, LL(1) stream control, and envelope abstraction are now battle-tested with both synthetic and realistic scripts. We’ve also documented token traits and spec’d out the language with clarity.

**Highlights:**

* ✅ **Tokenizer Engine Solidified**:
  The tokenizer now handles all known edge cases, respects stream rules, and correctly reduces the final token.

* 🔄 **Stream Logic (LL(1)) Modularized**:
  Introduced `ezbzll1.e` for simplified single-sequence LL(1) token flow. Reusable and easily swappable in future interpreters.

* 🧠 **Envelope Abstraction in `bztoken.e`**:
  Flat token records now serve as constructor args for the AST layer. Separation of concerns maintained for long-term flexibility.

* 🧪 **Manual & Automated Test Harnesses**:
  Added `bztoken-manual-test.ex` and `tests/bztoken_test.ex` to verify token output across symbol-heavy and minimal scripts.

* 📝 **Docs Expanded**:

  * `initial-lang-spec.md` reflects the bzscriptincluding sigil rules, braces, and expression terminators.
  * `notes_on_bztoken_types.md` tracks evolving roles and naming in the token layer.

* 🧼 **.gitignore & License**:
  Project hygiene improved. You’re now legally licensed to ride.
