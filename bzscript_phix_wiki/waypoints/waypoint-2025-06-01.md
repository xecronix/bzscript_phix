### ‚úÖ Waypoint ‚Äì 2025-06-01

**Title:**
**Group-Aware AST & Precedence Framework Online**

**Summary:**

* Implemented **group-aware parsing** using `op_group`, introducing the concept of `node_open` for deeper nesting visibility.
* Created a **working parse tree** for complex expressions like `{#a = (1 + 2)+ (3 * (4 + #b)+ #c);}` and verified recursive correctness.
* Introduced `child_on_both_sides()` to improve add/sub/mult/div logic resolution.
* Explicitly chose to preserve `(` tokens in AST for **meta-tagging** of expression intent (math, function, etc.).
* Parsed deep nesting in test case `{#n = ((((#x + 1) * 2) - ((3 / (#y + 4)) + 5)));}` successfully.
* Design philosophy shift: **happy-path first**, armor later. All safety features currently disabled to focus on parser logic flow.
* Identified and postponed implementation of **array groupings and delimiters** to maintain focus.
* Declared project evolution ‚Äî **language definitions now deserve their own file.**
* Discussion: Perl‚Äôs downfall may be its over-flexibility. BZScript aims to retain power but **fail fast with clarity.**

### ‚úÖ Git Commit Message

```
feat(ast): initial AST group-aware parsing w/ WEMDAS and node_open tokens

- Introduced group-aware    logic via `op_group` for nested parentheses
- Added new AST core: ast.e, ast_token.e
- Preserved `(` as `node_open` to retain semantic metadata
- Implemented child_on_both_sides() to support deep binary ops
- Added language.e to begin formalizing symbol definitions
- Verified correct tree for complex input: deeply nested math
- Safety checks deferred (happy-path only)
- Logging cleanup complete
```
