Absolutely — even without a GitHub repo or a VCS in place yet, a **waypoint** is your **temporal anchor**. It's how you mark:

* What was learned
* What was built
* What’s now “known”
* And what’s next

So here’s a clean `waypoint_YYYY_MM_DD.md` snapshot, formatted and ready to drop into a `waypoints/` folder or your `bzscript_wiki_eu`.

# 🧭 Waypoint — 2024-05-17

## ✅ Accomplished Today

### 🧠 LL1Stream Pattern (Eumem-Backed)
- Rebuilt the classic LL(1) pattern using `eumem` in OpenEuphoria
- Pattern supports:
  - `new`, `next`, `peek`, `recall`, `back`
  - `has_more`, `has_less`, `free`
- Locked in design: enum layout, type check via `LL1_ID`, pointer-based state
- Memory safety maintained; caller is responsible for not double-freeing

### 🧪 Testing
- Full test suite created using `std/unittest.e`
- 16 passing assertions covering all functional operations and edge cases
- Double-free and empty stream tested without crashing

### 📚 Philosophy Reinforced
- Re-validated long-standing pass-by-reference memory pattern
- Recognized that this pattern scales better than OOP in Euphoria/C/FreeBASIC
- Confirmed this design will power upcoming:
  - Tokenizer output
  - Categorizer stream handling
  - AST reducers

## 🌀 Considered But Deferred
- Switching to FreeBASIC (again) — rejected in favor of Euphoria.  It is
believed that Euphoria will allow faster prototyping

## 📝 Notes to Self
- Remember: type enforcement in function headers means NULL must never be passed
- Logging next (commenting and trace scaffolds)
- Project isn’t in GitHub yet — still local-only
- Might split `zeb_` folders in the future to separate Ant routing scaffolds

## 🌙 Plan After Break
- Add comments and lightweight log hooks to `LL1.e`
- Prepare mental ground for tokenizer and group parsing
- Rest. You’ve earned it.

> Tomorrow, it moves the language forward.”

# 🧭 Waypoint – 2025-05-17

## 🎯 Focus
Rebuilt the LL(1) pattern in OpenEuphoria using `eumem`-based memory structures. 
Verified that old patterns still apply. Recommitted to pointer-backed architecture over full OOP.

## ✅ Accomplished

### 🧱 LL1Stream Complete
- `LL1.e` now exposes:
  - `new`, `current`, `next`, `peek`, `recall`, `back`
  - `has_more`, `has_less`, `free`
- Fully pointer-driven
- Tested against copy-on-write behavior — **confirmed memory efficiency**
- Caller is responsible for lifecycle and type integrity

### 📦 Logger Module Built
- `logger.e` provides:
  - `init_logger`, `close_logger`
  - Level-based logging: `info`, `debug`, `trace`, `error`, `verbose`
  - `logger(level, msg)` unified public interface
- Log levels are configurable via `LOG_LEVEL`
- Outputs timestamped entries to file defined in `constants.e`
- Built-in safeguards for file open errors and invalid log types

### 🧪 Test Suite Passed
- `ll1_stream_test.ex` includes:
  - Head movement
  - Stream boundary handling
  - Empty stream case
  - Double free safety

### 🧠 Pattern Relearned
- Pass-by-reference structure reborn using `eumem`
- Pattern matches previous successful use in:
  - FreeBASIC
  - C
  - Prior Euphoria projects

## 🧬 Insight
> “Without this pattern, everything is passed by value.”  
> “With this pattern, I own my memory again.”

Confirmed that the memory+pointer+enum+type-tag design scales better than traditional OOP 
for this use case. Will be applied to:
- `Ant` data structures
- Stacks
- Future runtime memory models

---

## 🧭 Next Steps
- Logging and inline comments in `LL1.e`
- Reflect on how this architecture will support the categorizer
- Rest — momentum secured, architecture stable

---

> This was the day I reforged my memory pattern.  
> The work ahead will be easier because of it.
