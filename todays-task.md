☕ Morning Objectives (Post-Coffee Boot Sequence)
✅ 1. Logger Tool
Helps track tokenizer, categorizer, and AST steps

Suggestion: add log levels (e.g., TRACE, TOKEN, AST, WARN, ERROR)

Maybe a toggle to write to file vs. stdout for future integration

✅ 2. GitHub Init
Commit the tokenizer + BZToken spec + logger

If you want, I can draft a README scaffold or .gitignore for Euphoria-style projects

✅ 3. BZToken Generator
Function like make_bztoken(type, name, line, col, factory_id = "", tokens = {}, value = NULL)

This'll centralize creation and make logs more readable

✅ 4. Character Token Stream
You’ll finish phase 1 of the tokenizer (seed characters with line/column tracking)

Suggest storing source text as lines, then walking char-by-char

Emit: one token per character, with precise position
