# 🌱 BZScript – Struct Modeling, Includes, and AST Tree Traversal

## ✅ Recent Progress Overview

### ✅ 1. Struct System and Type Checking
- Introduced `%` sigil to represent structured sequences (structs).
- `%token` means a structured sequence with `__TYPE__` and `__MYSIZE__` fields.
- `@` continues to represent plain sequences.
- Added optional type checker functions:

```bzscript
public TAstToken(%s) {
	if (is_TAstToken){
		return %s;
	}
	abort("Type check failed for TAstToken.");
}

public is_TAstToken(%s){
    if (%s[__MYSIZE__] == #SIZEOF_AST_TOKEN) {
        if (equal(%s[__TYPE__], $AST_TOKEN_ID)) {
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
````

* Defined the TAstToken structure (based on Euphoria):

```euphoria
public enum  
    __TYPE__, _kind, _name, _line_num, _col_num, _value, _factory_request_str, _ast_tokens,
    __MYSIZE__
public constant SIZEOF_AST_TOKEN = __MYSIZE__
public constant AST_TOKEN_ID = "AST_TOKEN_ID$j56y7uw5tDESFWA#@$%^"
```

### ✅ 2. Functions and Init Logic

* Functions can be written to support implicit argument unpacking.
* Example of `token.init` using default arguments and manual assignment from `_args`.

```bzscript
public enum  
    __TYPE__, token.kind, token.name, 
    token.line_num, token.col_num, 
    token.value, token.factory_request_str, 
    token.ast_tokens,
    __MYSIZE__;
    
public fun token.init(TAstToken(%t), #kind=1, #value=6) {
    %t->token.kind = #kind;
    %t->token.value = #value;
    return %t;
}
```

* Alternative generic version (BuilderZebra-friendly):

```bzscript
public fun token.init(TAstToken(%t), #kind=1, #value=6) {
    for #i = 2 to length(@_args) {
        @_args[1][#i] = @_args[#i];
        if (#i + 1 == length(%t)) { exit; }
    }
    return @_args[1];
}
```

### ✅ 3. Include System Design

* Includes can now be grouped in a single call:

```bzscript
include (`dir/sub/file1.bzi`, `dir/sub/file2.bzi`);
```

* Include path resolution order (reversed from original intuition):

  1. Relative to file being parsed
  2. Relative to CWD
  3. `$BZSCRIPT_HOME/includes`

* Includes map to AST nodes as children of a `files` node under `root`.

### ✅ 4. AST Tree Structure & Printing

* Each token contains `_ast_tokens` for child elements.
* Recursive printer added for deep tree inspection:

```euphoria
public function print_ast_token(TAstToken token, integer indent = 0)
    ...
    for i = 1 to length(token[_ast_tokens]) do
        print_ast_token(token[_ast_tokens][i], indent + 1)
    end for
```

* Output example:

```
kind: 1026 name: @z.exp line: 1 col: 2 value:  factory request str: var_sequence
   kind: 1025 name: __BZ__NUMBER__ ...
   kind: 1026 name: + ...
   kind: 1026 name: [ ...
```

### ✅ 5. Design Philosophy

* Dot (`.`) in variable names is allowed; it's just part of the name, not a member access operator.
* Objects don't exist yet — structs are flat sequences with enforced structure.
* No runtime field resolution or function pointers (yet) — clarity and predictability are the goal.

---

## 🛠️ Upcoming Topics

* Finalize `include` resolution and `~include` token handling.
* Introduce namespacing and public/private/global scoping.
* Investigate optional parameter resolution via `_args`.
* Refactor group and block parsing into clean 2-pass compiler phases.
* Possibly reintroduce `def/ifdef` later with proper compiler-phase sigils. -- Maybe not? This is what BuilderZebra is for.

**🧠 Guiding Principle:**

> Anything not meaningful to the language is fair game for variable and function names. Even emojis.

**Next Action:**
You’re ready to continue with include resolution and namespace block scaffolding.
